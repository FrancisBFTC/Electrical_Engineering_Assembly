PWM Period = (PR2 + 1) x Cm x TRM2 Prescale

PWM duty cycle = (CCPR1L:CCP1CON<5:4>) x Tosc x TRM2 Prescale


PR2 = 255 (FF)
Cm  = 1us
TRM2 = 16 (1:16)

PWM Period = 256 x 1us x 16 = 4096us -> 4,096ms -> 4.1ms

Ptrm0 = 256

TRM0 = (TRM0 - D) x Cm x Ptrm0 
TRM0 = 65536ms


Simulation is not running in real time due to excessive CPU load.
